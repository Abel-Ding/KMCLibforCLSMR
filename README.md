# KMCLibforCLSMR
An application of kMC on Chemical looping steam  methane reforming

This is a project based on KMCLib written by leetmaa (https://github.com/leetmaa/KMCLib) for Chemical-looping steam methane reforming on perovskite/cerium oxides  oxygen carriers. 
This project forcus on the diffusion of lattice oxygen, reactions on surface of oxygen-carrier and the evolution of perovskites. We hopt to simulate the result in our previous study and analysis the kinetic parameters of experiments.
